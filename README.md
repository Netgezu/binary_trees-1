## Learning Objectives
>needed to be [explained](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/) after the project.

* What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
* What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
* What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
