## Learning Objectives
>needed to be [explained](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/) after the project.
* What is a binary tree
* What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Serch Tree
* What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
* What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
* What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
* What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

## Tasks To complete âš“

+ [ ] 0\. New node<br/>_**[0-binary_tree_node.c](0-binary_tree_node.c)**_ creates a binary tree node.
   + Prototype: `binary_tree_t *binary_tree_node(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);`
   + Where `parent` is a pointer to the parent node of the node to create
   + And `value` is the value to put in the new node
   + When created, a node does not have any child
   + Your function must return a pointer to the new node, or `NULL` on failure
